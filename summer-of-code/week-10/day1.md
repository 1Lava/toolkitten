Unity can be installed on both Mac and Windows. As well as android Studio 

### Prerequisites 
* Unity 3D - Try to pick one of the LTS releases : https://unity3d.com/es/unity/qa/lts-releases<br /> **Important** Check the box to allow the installation of Vuforia (Week11)
I am using 2017.4.7f1<br /> 2017.2.0f3 is the version we used the last time I tested 
#### For andorid deploy :
Follow the Unity documentation :https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-sdksetup.html

* JDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Android studio https://developer.android.com/studio/- Emulator is optional if you dont have to much space in your disk

#### For iOS deploy :
You need a Mac to build apps for iOS

* We are going to use an online modeling tool with basic functions :  online  https://www.tinkercad.com

* *optional* - 3D modeling software (Paint 3D in windows 10)  <br />
	* On windows 10 - Paint 3D
	* https://www.sketchup.com/
	* https://www.blender.org/


### Install Android environment in unity

**Hit** Sometimes the latest version of unity has problems identifying the android SDK during compiling. If you followed all the instructions and nothing seems to work, downgrate to another Unity version.

### Covering the basics

#### Unity layout
* Asset windows
* Hierarchy panel
* Game view
* Scene view

#### Lights and camera
In VR/AR expereinces it is good practice to have ONLY one main Camera
#### Importing assets from your computer

If you have Windows 10, you probably already have Paint3D installed. 
More resources can be found in Unity Assets Store <br />
Here some useful resources:
* https://free3d.com/3d-models/obj
* https://3dexport.com/free-3d-models
* https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models
* My personal favourite https://grabcad.com/

#### Customizing materials
* Standart shader
* Textures : An overview 
 <br /> This requires UVs previusly generated with the model

#### Deploy in emulator 

### Homework

Install all the Tools adn download some obj or make your own so that on day 2 we can start installing our apps :) 
- Create design in tinkerCAD and share the link
