## Week 10 Virtual reality

## Day 1

Small talk about VR hardware , VR applications

### Prerequisites 
* Unity 3D - Try to pick one of the LTS releases : https://unity3d.com/es/unity/qa/lts-releases<br /> **Important** Check the box to allow the installation of Vuforia (Week11)
I am using 2017.4.7f1<br /> 2017.2.0f3 is the version we used the last time I tested 
#### For andorid deploy :
Follow the Unity documentation :https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-sdksetup.html

* JDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Android studio https://developer.android.com/studio/- Emulator is optional if you dont have to much space in your disk
* *optional* - 3D modeling software (Paint 3D in windows 10)

### Install Android environment in unity


**Hit** Sometimes the latest version of unity has problems identifying the android SDK during compiling. If you followed all the instructions and nothing seems to work, downgrate to another Unity version.

### Covering the basics

#### Unity layout
#### Lights and camera
In VR/AR expereinces it is good practice to have ONLY one main Camera
#### Importing assets from your computer

If you have Windows 10, you probably already have Paint3D installed. 
More resources can be found in Unity Assets Store <br />

#### Create some interaction scripts.

Most of unity documentation and community support use C#
<br />
